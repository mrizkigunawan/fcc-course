            Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the
            name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php $Var = 'Bob';</code>
          <p>
            Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid
            variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any
            number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression,
            it would be expressed thus:
            ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php $var = 'Bob';</code>

            PHP provides a large number of predefined variables to any script
            which it runs. Many of these variables, however, cannot be fully
            documented as they are dependent upon which server is running, the
            version and setup of the server, and other factors. Some of these
            variables will not be available when PHP is run on the command line.
            Refer to the list of predefined variables for details.
          </p>
          <p>
            PHP also provides an additional set of predefined arrays containing
            variables from the web server (if applicable), the environment, and
            user input. These arrays are rather special in that they are
            automatically global - i.e., automatically available in every scope.
            For this reason, they are often known as "superglobals". (There is
            no mechanism in PHP for user-defined superglobals.) Refer to the
            list of superglobals for details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If certain variables in variables_order are not set, their
            appropriate PHP predefined arrays are also left empty.

            The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined.
            For the most part all PHP variables only have a single scope. This
            single scope spans included and required files as well. For example:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php $a = 1;</code>
          <p>
            Here the $a variable will be available within the included b.inc
            script. However, within user-defined functions a local function
            scope is introduced. Any variable used inside a function is by
            default limited to the local function scope. For example:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php $a = 1;</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Variables">
        <header>Variable Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A variable variable takes the value of a variable and treats that as
            the name of a variable. In the above example, hello, can be used as
            the name of a variable by using two dollar signs. i.e.
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php $$a = "hello";</code>
          <p>
            At this point two variables have been defined and stored in the PHP
            symbol tree: $a with contents "hello" and $hello with contents
            "world". Therefore, this statement:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?php echo "$a ${$a}";</code>
        </article>

            When a form is submitted to a PHP script, the information from that
            form is automatically made available to the script. There are few
            ways to access this information, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Example #1 A simple HTML form</li>
            <li>Example #2 Accessing data from a simple POST HTML form</li>
            <li>Example #3 More complex form variables</li>
            <li>Example #4</li>
            <li>Example #5</li>
          </ul>
